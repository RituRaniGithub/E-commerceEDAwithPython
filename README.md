# E-commerceEDAwithPython

## Overview

This dataset contains synthetic data of product sales in an e-commerce platform, generated using random functions in Python. It is created for practice and learning purposes and does not represent any real company. The dataset may contain anomalies and should be used solely for practice. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raniritu/ecommercedata

## Objective

The main objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and gain insights from e-commerce sales. Through EDA, we aim to answer specific questions about the dataset and understand its characteristics.

## Questions to Answer

During the exploratory data analysis, we will address the following questions:

1. What are the top-selling products based on the quantity sold, and what is the corresponding revenue generated by each of these products?

2. How do product promotions impact sales? Are products with promotions selling better than non-promoted products?

3. How do customer ratings vary across different product categories? Are there any categories with higher average ratings than others?

4. What is the distribution of customer ages and genders in the dataset?

5. Are there any geographical patterns in product sales? Which locations (countries) have the highest and lowest sales volumes?

6. What is the overall revenue generated by ShopBasket during the given period?
